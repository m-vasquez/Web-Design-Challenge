# Web Design Homework - Web Visualization Dashboard 

## Summary

Web Visualization of a study done on crime and its potential factors using HTML, CSS, Python, and Bootstrap 4 to create a dashboard showing off the analysis done, specifically, plotting crime data. In building this dashboard, individual pages were created for each plot and a means by which we can navigate between them. These pages contain the visualizations and their corresponding explanations. There is also a landing page, a page where we can see a comparison of all of the plots, and another page where we can view the data used to build them.
