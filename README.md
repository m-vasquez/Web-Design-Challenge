# Web Design Homework - Web Visualization Dashboard 

## Summary

Web Visualization of a study done on crime and its potential factors using HTML, CSS, Bootstrap 4, as well as Python including Plotly, Matplotlib and Pandas libraries to create a dashboard showing the analysis done, specifically, plotting crime data. In building this dashboard individual pages were created for each plot and a means by which we can navigate between them. These pages contain the visualizations and their corresponding explanations. A landing page can be found along with a page where comparisons of all plots can be viewed, an interactive state map that shows crime data by state, as well as an additional page where the data used to be build the charts can be found.
